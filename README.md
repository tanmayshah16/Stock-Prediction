# Stock Prediction

# Project Overview

The stock market appears in the news every day. You hear about it every time it reaches a new high or a new low. A wealth of information is available in the form of historical stock prices and company performance data, suitable for learning algorithms to process. Investors make educated guesses by analyzing data. They'll read the news, study the company history, industry trends and other lots of data points that go into making a prediction. 
This project utilizes Deep Learning models, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network algorithm, to predict stock prices. I have used Keras to build a LSTM to predict stock prices using historical closing price and trading volume and visualize both the predicted price values over time and the optimal parameters for the model.

Things I have learnt from this project:
  * How to collect and preprocess given data.
  * How to use tensorflow library.
  * How to apply deep learning algorithm - LSTM.
  * How to optimise LSTM algortithm.
